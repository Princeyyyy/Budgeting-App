# Budgeting App

## Description

This is an Android application designed to help people keep track of how their money is spent. A
user sets their monthly budget, and as they go about using the money and logging it into the app,
they will be able to view all their expenditures. This also includes pie charts to illustrate and
visualize their money. On top of that users will be able to know if they are overspending and by how
much in order to improve.
